# Objective  
This project seeks to derive actionable insights from the UK Road Safety Accident Data for the year 2023. By leveraging structured accident, vehicle, and casualty records published by the Department for Transport, the analysis aims to support data-informed decision-making in road safety management.

The primary objective is to identify critical patterns in road traffic incidents with a focus on spatial distribution, temporal trends, environmental conditions, demographic vulnerability, and vehicle involvement. These insights are intended to assist public authorities, urban planners, and policy stakeholders in optimizing intervention strategies and resource allocation.
